 What is Nuitka
****************

Nuitka is the optimizing Python compiler written in Python that creates
executables that run without an need for a separate installer. Data
files can both be included or put alongside.

It is easy to use and just works. It is fully compatible with Python2
(2.6, 2.7) and Python3 (3.3 - 3.10), works on Windows, macOS, Linux and
more, basically where Python works for you already.

Nuitka Standard
===============

The standard edition bundles your code and data into a single executable.
It's freely distributed under the Apache license.

`Get Nuitka Standard </pages/download.html>`_.

Nuitka Commercial
=================

The commercial edition additionally protects your code, data and outputs,
so that users of the executable cannot access these.
It's a private repository that of plugins that you pay to access to.
